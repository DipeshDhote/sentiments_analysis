# Sentiment Analysis
## Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on text data, categorizing the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool that can be applied in various domains such as customer feedback, social media analysis, and product reviews.

## Features
- Preprocessing: Text cleaning (removal of stopwords, punctuation, and special characters).
- Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.
- Vectorization: Converting tokens into numerical form using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
- Modeling: Building machine learning or deep learning models such as LSTM for classification.
- Evaluation: Measuring model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Deployment: Option to deploy the model using Flask, FastAPI, or Docker.
